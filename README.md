# COVID-19's Impact on San Francisco International Airport

This is a pdf of my Tableau data dashboard visualizing the impact of COVID-19 on passengers at SFO airport in 2020.

It should be noted that the data was extracted in September 2020 as a part of an assignment and does not encompass the entire year. The final passenger count for 2020 at SFO airport was 16,418,713, still drastically below the previous years' counts.

This data was taken from SF OpenData at https://www.flysfo.com/media/facts-statistics/air-traffic-statistics.
